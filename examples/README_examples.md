# Examples

This folder can host additional runnable examples. Right now, the primary demonstration lives in `notebooks/demo_logistic_regression.ipynb` and the main script `app/main.py`.

Ideas for future examples:

- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.
- Demonstrating class imbalance handling with class weights.
- Comparing L1 vs L2 regularization.
